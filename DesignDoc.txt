1) Make a button that enables or disables the rufus_scheduler bot that constantly updates our data using the CREST api

# controller
class ExpensesController < ApplicationController
  JOHN_EXPENSE = 20
  MARK_EXPENSE = 30
end

# view
John's expense is: <%= ExpensesController::JOHN_EXPENSE %> 
Mark's expense is: <%= ExpensesController::MARK_EXPENSE %> 




2) The scheduler bot will increment through 'pages' of the huge dataset.





3) CREST API
